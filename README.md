# Goal
Provide some sensible and concise default dev shell environments for different languages using nix flakes.

# How to use them
Use the nix develop command, e.g. `nix develop --no-write-lock-file github:BossCode45/language-flakes#cpp`.

# How to contribute
Simply add a new devShell output to the flake and send a PR.
